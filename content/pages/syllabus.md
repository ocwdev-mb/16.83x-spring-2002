Course Structure
----------------

Space Systems Engineering (16.83X) is a complex sequence of three courses.  The focus of each course differs because each deals with a distinct stage of product development.  The 16.83/16.831/16.832 program plan contains details of the project itself, as well as scheduling, grading and communications.

The program plan below contains some references to course numbers 16.684, 16.685, 16.686, and 16.68x.  These numbers served as temporary course numbers for 16.83X.  This course sequence has now passed the experimental phase and has adopted its permanent course numbers of 16.83, 16.831, 16.832 (also known collectively as 16.83X).
